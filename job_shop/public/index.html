      content="The JobShop system aims to enhance the job search experience by providing tailored job recommendations that align with users' specific skills and preferences, offering a comprehensive platform for managing recruitment processes. The system includes three main types of users: Job Seekers, Company Administrators, and Employers.
      System Functions:
      Job Seeker: Creates a profile containing their skills, qualifications, and contact information. They can search for suitable jobs, apply for them, and track the status of their applications. The system provides job recommendations that match at least 60% of their skills and highlights the remaining skills needed to improve their fit.
      Company Administrator: Manages recruitment operations, creates employer accounts, and oversees the company page, which includes all posts and the fields the company operates in.
      Employer: Creates job posts that include job details, required skills and qualifications, and an illustrative picture. Manages job posts and reviews applications from job seekers, with the ability to accept or reject them. Employers can also see the match percentage for each applicant to identify the best candidates.
      JobShow Advantage:
      The primary advantage of JobShop is its ability to offer personalized job recommendations that better match users' skills and preferences compared to platforms like LinkedIn, which often provide generic job suggestions. Additionally, the system offers feedback to job seekers on the skills they need to develop, increasing their chances of securing targeted jobs.
      In summary, JobShop provides a comprehensive and customized solution for connecting job seekers with suitable jobs, while enhancing the recruitment process for employers, making it an ideal platform for improving labor market efficiency and effectiveness."
